# Readme

This *readme* file is to inform on the utility of our analysis and information provided. Special attention is paid to the proteccion of both participants' and Twitter users' personal data. 

## Contained Files

Our analysis consists of the following datafiles

> 1. readme.md
> 2. calculation_of_emotive_values.R
> 3. data_preparation.R
> 4. final_stats
> 5. graph_generation.R
> 6. license

# Data Protection

## Legal basis

According to the General Data Protection Regulation (henceforth GDPR) valid (April 14th, 2016) and enforceable in the European Union (EU) as of May 25th, 2018, the processing of personalized or potentially personalized data is prohibited, unless affected persons express their consent or the regulation permits the processing of data otherwise. 

Users of Twitter do subscribe to Twitter's data protection agreement, which grants permission to process data on the grounds of justified interests (Article 6.1) especially in a scientific context (Articles 85, 89). The further publication of this data, however, is not justifiable since "pseudonymisation" (in the sense of Article 4.5) is not techincally possible. Linguistic material that was recompiled from Twitter, can, by virtue of containing a linguistic expression, be traced back to its author without costly expenses in ressources or time.

Since Chapter 9 (Articles 85 through 91) does not justify to compromise Article 11.1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union which grants freedom of expression and the right to hold opinions without interference by public authority (or other parties), we estimate that the free publication of our dataset might compromise the rights of users. This is because some of the analysed material does allow for the attribution of politcal opinions to their authors. Publication of these opinions on Twitter does **not** entail the right for third parties to further distribute these opinions and target the authors.

## Access to our datasets

For the sake of data proteccion (in accordance with the European GDPR, we will refrain ourselves from providing this repository with the actual dataset. Researchers and students, however, can request access from the authors in order to do reproduction experiments on the original data.

We estimate that this practise provides the most reasonable balance between reproducibility and data protection. 

# Analysis replication

The files in this repository are to replicate the findings of Castro-Toledo, Gretenkort, Esteve, & Miró-Llinares (in press). In order to replicate the findings, use the files "data_preparation.R", "statistical_code.R", and "graph_generation.R" on the dataset that you can request from the corresponding authors. The file "calculation_of_emotive_values.R" is merely a reproduction of how we calculate the emotional values for each Tweet, given that these values are already present in the dataset. In order to replicate, you can use this as well.
